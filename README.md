# Some basic information:
## I'm writing this as of August 6th, 2024
This website consists of a couple of good concept themes which I tried -- for starters, this website taught me I wanted to go for more of a vertical-down approach to my website -- instead of having multiple different pages, it's all a "single" page where the navbar corresponds to sections of the page (so menu on top, about me bottom, projects underneath, etc).

## File Information
The files aren't really named that well, but "main.html" is the file where the website is located and it uses "stylesheet.css". Javascript code is located in a script tag within the main.html (yes, I know, bad coding practice)!

## Some of the things I actually really liked in this model:
- The menu screen was really good - I loved the background of me dunking a basketball (on an 8 feet rim).
- The about-me section was exactly what I hoped for - it was kind of minimalistic while still being able to fit in a more personal vibe. People who know me know I'm an absolute HATER of minimalism and minimalistic concepts, so I wanted to showcase a lot of my personality in whatever final site I ended up with.
- It taught me a lot about web-dev and web-content creation -- it has been a LONG while since I've made a site (about 2020-2021), so redoing that in my offtime this summer has been particularly rewarding and a good experience and this first attempt got the 

## Now onto the things I kind of hated about this version of the website:
- It was TERRIBLY unresponsive. I really didn't want to make a new site but it occurred to me that if I ever wanted to make the website responsive again, it would be incredibly challenging to a point where remaking the site would be significantly easier... I knew it was time to change things.
- The carousel for projects was a good idea at the start, but Bootstrap's implementation of that is terrible -- I thought about using cards for this at the start but Bootstraps implementation of that is also pretty terrible -- I came to the conclusion that I should resort to pre-made card-content on the web that I could use in my site.
- It felt like the "linear connection" of the site was so lost because there was no real "navbar" menu. For those who aren't particularly used to this layout, if the menu occupies the whole viewport, it becomes incredibly challenging to know THAT things are in a linear format -- this is particularly because I use edge and smooth-scrolling (linking to parts in a website by scrolling) and sticky positioning (scrolling so that when you get near to a section it locks it so you see the whole section in the viewport - particularly useful if you scroll and you get to a situation where the remainder of the viewport is left).
- Bad vibes if I can use that word... it felt sort of like me, but also sort of not like me. I care a lot about representing myself in my website and this wasn't really doing me justice.

## Lessons learned for those interested in web-development and making things:
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) -- I really overcomplicated things with this one and was forced to make things simple again to implement it, and in that process a lot of the initial functionality was lost and the site sort of tore down.
- It is absolutely ok to NOT use parts of bootstrap when implementing things -- I really wanted to stick to Bootstrap but unfortunately it couldn't do everything so I had to change things up (particularly with the menu).
